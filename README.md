**A. Total Sales Performance by Department**

Food department is the highest revenue generator, contributing over Â£3.99 million in total sales.Clothing & Footwear follows with approximately Â£1.77 million, while Homeware records significantly lower sales at Â£60,559. This highlights an opportunity to reassess inventory, pricing strategies and promotions in the Homeware department.

**B. Stores Sales Performance**

Glasgow outperforms all other stores, generating the highest sales.Other stores such as Edinburgh and Aberdeen also show strong performance, while Inverness and Stirling have lower sales, suggesting potential issues withÂ demand in those locations.

**C. Impact of Promotions on Sales**

Promotional activities significantly boost sales, with over Â£5.1 million generated under promotions compared to Â£1.46 million without promotions. This reinforces the importance of strategically timed promotions to maximise revenue.

**Findings:**

ðŸŽ¯TheÂ department is operating at a loss, given the low sales volume and overhead costs. There is need to consider price adjustments or reallocation of store space to more profitable categories.

ðŸŽ¯Food distribution is a critical cost component and the analysis sought to minimise transportation costs from M&Sâ€™s northern distribution centers, by using optimisation models, it will be ensured that each store receives at least its maximum non promotion daily sales while reducing overall distribution expenses. Hence resulting in more efficient routing and delivery scheduling which leads to cost savings without impacting store supply levels.

**Recommendations for Action**

Based on the findings, I propose the following data driven strategies:

ðŸŽ¯Strengthen Homeware sales by reassessing pricing, promotional strategies and in store marketing.

ðŸŽ¯Expand promotional campaigns especially for high-margin products as they impact on sales.

ðŸŽ¯Optimise inventory management in low performing stores such as Inverness and Stirling to reduce unsold stock and improve turnover.

ðŸŽ¯Implement cost efficient food distribution strategies to lower logistical expenses.

ðŸŽ¯Enhance data analytics capabilities to improve forecasting, customer insights and operational efficiency.

**Conclusion**

This analysis demonstrates the power of data analytics in helping M&S make better decisions. M&S Scotland stores can enhance profitability, operations and increase future growth by adopting these recommendations,
