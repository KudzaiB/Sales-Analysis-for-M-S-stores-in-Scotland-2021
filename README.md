This analysis aims to show how data analytics offers more in depth understanding of M&S's sales performance in Scotland. The objectives of the study are to increase operational effectiveness, boost profitability and optimise logistics by utilising data driven decision making.

âœ…Key Insights from the Sales Dashboard
The interactive Sales Department Dashboard summarises sales performance across nine M&S stores in Scotland for the period 01/01/21 to 31/03/21. Key findings include:

ðŸŽ¯ Total Sales Performance by Department
Food department is the highest revenue generator, contributing over Â£3.99 million in total sales.
Clothing & Footwear follows with approximately Â£1.77 million, while Homeware records significantly lower sales at Â£60,559.
This highlights an opportunity to reassess inventory, pricing strategies and promotions in the Homeware department.

ðŸŽ¯ Store-Wise Sales Performance
Glasgow outperforms all other stores, generating the highest sales.
Other stores such as Edinburgh and Aberdeen also show strong performance, while Inverness and Stirling have lower sales, suggesting potential issues with demand in those locations.

ðŸŽ¯ Impact of Promotions on Sales
Promotional activities significantly boost sales, with over Â£5.1 million generated under promotions compared to Â£1.46 million without promotions.
This reinforces the importance of strategically timed promotions to maximise revenue.

âœ…Risk Analysis â€“ Aberdeen Homeware Profitability
Using Monte Carlo Simulation, we assessed the profitability of the Aberdeen Homeware department, assuming:
Gross profit margins of 60% - 70% on revenue sales.
Fixed daily overhead contribution of Â£4,250.

âœ…Findings:

The department is operating at a loss, given the low sales volume and overhead costs.
Recommendations: Consider price adjustments, targeted marketing efforts, or reallocation of store space to more profitable categories.
Optimisation â€“ Minimising Food Distribution Costs
Food distribution is a critical cost component, and our analysis sought to minimise transportation costs from M&Sâ€™s northern distribution centers.
Using optimisation models, we ensured that each store received at least its maximum non-promotion daily sales while reducing overall distribution expenses.
Outcome: More efficient routing and delivery scheduling could lead to cost savings without impacting store supply levels.

âœ…Critical Considerations and Data Impact

The dataset was cleaned and validated to ensure accuracy and eliminate inconsistencies.
Missing data points were identified and corrected.
The analysis highlights the need for continuous monitoring and data validation to maintain decision-making accuracy.

âœ…Recommendations for Action
Based on the findings, I propose the following data-driven strategies:
Strengthen Homeware sales by reassessing pricing, promotional strategies, and in-store marketing.
Expand promotional campaigns, especially for high-margin products, given their significant impact on sales.
Optimise inventory management in low-performing stores such as Inverness and Stirling to reduce unsold stock and improve turnover.
Implement cost-efficient food distribution strategies to lower logistical expenses.
Enhance data analytics capabilities to improve forecasting, customer insights, and operational efficiency.

âœ…Conclusion

This analysis demonstrates the power of business analytics in helping M&S make smarter, data-driven decisions. By adopting these recommendations, M&S Scotland can enhance profitability, streamline operations, and drive future growth.
